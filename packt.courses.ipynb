      "family. Mr. Darcy's father was excessively attached to me:--indeed, I\n",
      "was his godson. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had\n",
      "done so. I was destined for the church and Mr. Darcy's father left to me\n",
      "a most valuable living. But the present Mr. Darcy chose to ignore his\n",
      "father's will and gave the living to another man. This closed for me the\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "WICKHAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "I must attribute it in some measure to his jealousy. His father's\n",
      "uncommon attachment to me irritated him, but the fact is, Miss\n",
      "Elizabeth, as you can see, we are very different men, and he hates me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ELIZABETH.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "WICKHAM.\n",
      "\n",

    "of a responsible developer. It is as important as writing documentation or tests. Many people \n",
    "consider logging the \"runtime documentation\"; the same way developers read the documentation when\n",
    "interacting with the DevOps source code, and other developers will use the log traces when the \n",
    "application is running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardcore logging advocates state that debuggers are extremely overused, and people should rely \n",
    "more on logging, using both info and trace logs to troubleshoot their code in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that if you are not able to troubleshoot your code with the highest level of verbosity\n",
    "in development, then you may have issues in production that you won't be able to figure out the root \n",

    "\n",
    "Using Logging\n",
    "Logging is the best way to let the users of the running application know which state the process is\n",
    "in, and how it is processing its work. It can also be used for auditing or troubleshooting client\n",
    "issues. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to figure out how your application behaved \n",
    "last week and having no information at all about what happened when it faced an issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also be careful about what information we log. Many companies will require users to never\n",
    "log information such as credit cards or any sensitive user data. Whilst it is possible to conceal\n",
    "such data after it is logged, it is better to be mindful when we log it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder what is wrong with just using print statements, but when you start to write \n",
    "large-scale applications or libraries, you realize that just using print does nothing to\n",
    "instrument an application. By using the logging module, you also get the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading support: The logging module is designed to work in multithreaded environments.\n",
    "    This is needed when using multiple threads as, otherwise, the data that you log will get\n",
    "    interleaved, as can happen with print.\n",
    "Categorization through multiple levels of logging: When using print, there is no way to transmit \n",
    "    the importance of the log trace being emitted. By using logging, we can choose the category\n",
    "    that we want to log under to transmit the importance of it.\n",
    "Separation of concerns between instrumentation and configuration: There are two different users \n",
    "    of the logging library — users who just emit and those who configure the logging stack. The \n",
    "    logging library separates those nicely, allowing libraries and applications to just instrument\n",
    "    their code with logs at different levels, and the final user to configure the logging stack at\n",
    "    will.\n",
    "Flexibility and configurability: The logging stack is easily extensible and configurable. There\n",
    "    are many types of handlers, and it is trivial to create new classes that extend its\n",
    "    functionality. There is even a cookbook on how to extend the logging stack in the standard \n",
    "    library documentation.\n",
    "The main class you interact with when using the logging library is logger. can be used to emit \n",
    "logs in any category. You usually create loggers by getting them through the logging.getLogger\n",
    "(<logger name>) factory method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a logger object, you can call the different logging methods that match the different \n",

    "debug: Fine-grained messages that are helpful for debugging and troubleshooting applications,\n",
    "    usually enabled in development. As an example, a web server will log the input payload when \n",
    "    receiving a request at this level.\n",
    "info: Coarse-grained informational messages that highlight the progress of an application. As an \n",
    "    example, a web server will emit the requests being handled at this level without details of\n",
    "    the data being received.\n",
    "warning: Messages that inform the user of a potentially harmful situation in the application or\n",
    "    library. In our example of a web server, this will happen if you fail to decode an input JSON \n",
    "    payload because it is corrupted. Note that while it might feel like an error and it might be\n",
    "    for the whole system, if you own the frontend as well, the issue is not in the application\n",
    "    handling the request; it is in the process sending it. Therefore, a warning might help notify\n",
    "    the user of such an issue, but it is not an error. The error should be reported to the client \n",
    "    as an error response, and the client should handle it as appropriate.\n",
    "error: Used for situations where an error has taken place, but the application can continue to\n",
    "    function properly. Logging an error usually means there is an action that needs to be carried \n",
    "    out by a developer in the source code that logged it. Logging errors commonly happen when you\n",
    "    capture an exception, and you have no way of handling it effectively. It is quite common to\n",
    "    set up alerts in connection with errors to inform the DevOps or developer that an error\n",
    "    situation took place. In our web server application, this might happen if you fail to encode \n",
    "    a response or an exception is raised that was not expected when handling the request.\n",
    "fatal: Fatal logs indicate that there has been an error situation that compromises the current\n",
    "    stability of the program, and, quite often, the process is restarted after a fatal message\n",
    "    is logged. A fatal log means that the application needs an operator to take action urgently,\n",
    "    compared to an error that a developer is expected to handle. A common situation is when the\n",
    "    connection to a database is lost, or any other resource that is key for the application is \n",
    "    no longer reachable.\n",
    "Logger Object\n",
    "Loggers have a hierarchy of names split by a dot. For example, if you ask for a logger named my.\n",

    "Logging in warning, error, and fatal Categories\n",
    "You should be mindful when you log in warning, error, and fatal. If there is something worse\n",
    "than an error, it is two errors. Logging an error is a way of informing the system of a situation\n",
    "that needs to be handled, and if you decide to log an error and raise an exception, you are basically\n",
    "duplicating the information. As a rule of thumb, following these two pieces of advice is key to an \n",
    "application or library that logs errors effectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "Never ignore an exception that transmits an error silently. If you handle an exception that notifies\n",
    "you of an error, log that error.\n",
    "Never raise and log an error. If you are raising an exception, the caller has the ability to decide\n",
    "whether it is truly an error situation, or whether they were expecting the issue to occur. They can\n",
    "then decide whether to log it following the previous rule, to handle it, or to re-raise it.\n",
    "A good example of where the user might be tempted to log an error or warning is in the library of\n",
    "a database when a constraint is violated. From the library perspective, this might look like an \n",
    "error situation, but the user might be trying to insert it without checking whether the key was\n",
    "already in the table. The user can therefore just try to insert and ignore the exception, but \n",
    "if the library code logs a warning when such a situation happens, the warning or error will just\n",
    "spew the log files without a valid reason. Usually, a library will rarely log an error unless it \n",
    "has no way of transmitting the error through an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are handling exceptions, it is quite common to log them and the information they come \n",
    "with. If you want to include the exception and trace back the full information, you can use the\n",

    "Figure 6.29: Example output when logging an exception with exc_info.\n",
    "The error information now includes the message you passed in, but also the exception that \n",
    "was being handled with the traceback. This is so useful and common that there is a shortcut\n",
    "for it. You can call the exception method to achieve the same as using error with exc_info:\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    int(\"nope\")\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    logging.exception(\"Something bad happened\")\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6.30: Example output when logging an exception with the exception method\n",
    "Now, you will review two common bad practices with the logging module.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one is a greedy string formatting. You might see some linters complain about formatting\n",
    "a string by the user, rather than relying on the logging module's string interpolation. This means\n",
    "that logging.info(\"string template %s\", variable) is preferred over \n",
    "logging.info(\"string template {}\".format(variable)). This is the case since, if you perform the \n",
    "string interpolation with the format, you will be doing it no matter how we configure the logging \n",
    "stack. If the user who configures the application decides that they don't need to print out the logs\n",
    "in the information level, you will have to perform interpolation, when it wasn't necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "# prefer\n",
    "logging.info(\"string template %s\", variable)\n",
    "# to\n",
    "logging.info(\"string template {}\".format(variable))\n",
    "Note: Linters are programs that detect code style violations, errors, and suggestions for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other, more important, bad practice is capturing and formatting exceptions when it's not really\n",
    "needed. Often, you see developers capturing broad exceptions and formatting them manually as part\n",
    "of a log message. This is not only boilerplate but also less explicit. Compare the following two \n",
    "approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "d = dict()\n",
    "# Prefer\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    d[\"missing_key\"] += 1\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    logging.error(\"Something bad happened\", exc_info=True)\n",
    "# to\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    d[\"missing_key\"] += 1\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    logging.error(\"Something bad happened: %s\", e)\n",
    "The output is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6.31: Example output difference of exc_info versus logging an exception string\n",
    "The output in the second approach will only print the text of the exception, without further\n",
    "information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 6.32: Example output difference of exc_info versus logging an exception string\n",
    "We don't know if it was a key error, nor where the issue appeared. If the exception was raised\n",
    "without a message, we would just get an empty message. Additionally, if logging an error, use \n",
    "an exception, and you won't need to pass exc_info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring the Logging Stack\n",
    "Another part of the logging library is the functions to configure it, but before diving into how \n",
    "to configure the logging stack, you should understand its different parts and the role they play.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already seen logger objects, which are used to define the logging messages that need to be\n",
    "generated. There are also the following classes, which take care of the process of processing and \n",
    "emitting a log:\n",
    "\n",
    "Log Records: This is the object that is generated by the logger and contains all the information \n",
    "    about the log, including the line where it was logged, the level, the template, and arguments,\n",
    "    among others.\n",
    "Formatters: These take log records and transform them into strings that can be used by handlers that \n",
    "    output to streams.\n",
    "Handlers: These are the ones that actually emit the records. They frequently use a formatter to \n",
    "    transform records into strings. The standard library comes with multiple handlers to emit log\n",
    "    records into stdout, stderr, files, sockets, and so on.\n",
    "Filters: Tools to fine-tune log record mechanisms. They can be added to both handlers and loggers.\n",
    "If the functionality that is already provided by the standard library is not enough, you can always\n",
    "create our own kind of classes that customize how the logging process is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The logging library is truly flexible. If you are interested in doing so, read through the\n",
    "    logging cookbook in the Python official documentation to see some examples at docs.python.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with this knowledge, there are multiple ways to configure all of the elements of the logging\n",

    "Caching with functools.lru_cache\n",
    "Often, you have a function that is heavy to compute, in which you just want to cache results. Many developers will create their own caching implementation by using a dictionary, but that is error-prone and adds unnecessary code to our project. The functools module comes with a decorator — that is, functools.lru_cache, which is provided exactly for these situations. It is a recently used cache, with a max_size that is provided when the code is constructed. This means that you can specify a number of input values that you want to cache as a maximum, to limit the memory this function can take, or it can grow indefinitely. Once you reach the maximum number of different inputs that we want to cache, the input that was the least recently used will be thrown away in favor of a new call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the decorator provides some new methods in the function that can be used to interact with the cache. We can use cache_clear to remove all of the previous hits saved in cache or cache_info to get information about the hits and misses, so as to allow us to tune it if needed. The original function information is also offered for inspection, as with any properly decorated function, through the __wrapped__ decorator.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep in mind that the LRU cache should be used only in functions. This is useful if we just want to reuse existing values or the side effect will not happen. As an example, we should not use the cache on a function that writes something into a file or sends a package to an endpoint, as those actions will not be performed once the function is called again with the same input, which is the main purpose of the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, for the cache to be usable in a function, all objects being passed need to be hashable. This means that integers, frozensets, tuples, and so on are allowed, but not modifiable objects, such as dicts, sets, or lists.\n",

    "Software development goes beyond writing code. In previous Becoming Pythonic course, you were introduced to the idea of being Pythonic. When you write software as professionals, we expect the code to be up to a certain standard and to be able to manage and distribute that code in a way that can be easily consumed by other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, you will go through the various concepts and tools that allow you to elevate the level of your source code and applications. You will examine Python tools that every Python developer uses for testing, writing documentation, packaging their code, and version control, as well as learning about techniques that allow us to debug issues that occur in existing code. Additionally, you will write tests to validate our assumptions and implementations of our code. These are all concepts and tools that are key to any successful developer in any company, as they allow developers to develop and collaborate effectively.

    "Debugging a Salary Calculator\n",
    "In this exercise, you will use the skills you learned to use pdb to debug an application that is not working as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a salary calculator. Our company is using this to calculate the salary increase that will be given to our employees year after year, and a manager has reported that she is getting a 20% raise when the rulebook seems to suggest that she should be getting a 30% raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are just told that the manager's name is Rose, and you will find that the code for the salary raise calculation is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " Exercise112.py \n",
    "\n",
    "3 def _manager_adjust(salary, rise):\n",
    "4     if rise < 0.10:\n",
    "5         # We need to keep managers happy.\n",

    "16     if not is_good_year:\n",
    "For full code, refer here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you read this code on GitHub, it is quite convoluted and difficult to read, but it applies different raises depending on factors such as whether the person is a manager, whether it was a good year and the person's current salary. The aim here is to provide you with a complex code structure so that you can debug it by following the steps mentioned in this exercise. This could be very helpful in your everyday developer life as well when you are provided with a bunch of code, and you need to find a way to debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps will help you complete this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the problem by asking the right questions.\n",
    "The first step is to fully understand the issue, evaluate whether there is an issue with the source code, and to get all the possible data. You need to ask the user who reported the error, and ourselves, common questions such as the following indent question list:\n",
    "\n",
    "What version of the software were they using?\n",
    "\n",
    "When did the error happen for the first time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Has it worked before?\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it an intermittent failure, or can the user consistently reproduce it?\n",
    "\n",
    "What was the input of the program when the issue manifested?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the output and what would be the expected output?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we have any logs or any other information to help us debug the issue?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance, you get to know that this happened with the last version of our script and the person who reported it could reproduce it. It seems to be happening only to Rose, but that might be related to the arguments she is providing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, she reported that her current salary is $1,000,000. She was told she would get a 30% raise, and even if she is aware that managers earning that much get a penalty of 10%, as the company had a good year and she was a high earner, she was expecting a 10% bonus, which should amount to 30%. But she saw that her new salary was $1,200,000, rather than $1,300,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can translate this into the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "salary: 1,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "promised_pct: 0.30.\n",
    "\n",
    "is_manager: True\n",
    "\n",
    "is_good_year: True\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected output was 1,300,000, and the output she reported was 1,200,000.We don't have any logs about the execution, as the code was not instrumented with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reproduce the issue by running the calculate_new_salary function and the known arguments.\n",
    "The next step in our debugging investigation is to confirm that you can reproduce the issue. If you are not able to reproduce it, then it means that some of the input or assumptions that either we or the user made were incorrect, and you should go back to step 1 for clarification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, trying to reproduce the issue is easy—you need to run the function with the known arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "rose_salary = calculate_new_salary(1_000_000, 0.30, True, True)\n",
    "print(\"Rose's salary will be:\", rose_salary)\n",
    "The output will be as follows:\n",
    "1200000\n",
    "This effectively returns 1200000 rather than 1,300,000, and you know from the HR guidelines that she should be getting the latter. Indeed, something starts to look suspicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code with the other current inputs, such as 1,000,000 and 2,000,000, to see the difference.\n",
    "In some situations, it is helpful to try with other inputs to see how the program behaves before even running the debugger. This can give you some extra information. You know that there are special rules for people that earn a million dollars or more, so what happens if you raise that number to, say, $2,000,000?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "rose_salary = calculate_new_salary(2_000_000, 0.30, True, True)\n",
    "print(\"Rose's salary will be:\", rose_salary)\n",
    "You see that, now, the output is 2,400,000. The raise was 20% rather than 30%. There is something wrong in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also try changing the percentage, so let's try that with a promised initial raise of 40%:\n",
    "\n",
    "rose_salary = calculate_new_salary(1_000_000, 0.40, True, True)\n",
    "print(\"Rose's salary will be:\", rose_salary)\n",
    "The output will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rose's salary will be: 1400000\n",
    "Interestingly, she would get a 40% raise because there is no penalty applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "From just trying out different inputs, you have seen what is special about Rose's situation, it is her 30% increase. When you start to debug things in the following step, you will see that you should keep an eye on the code that interacts with the promised percentage, as the initial salary change did not make a difference.\n",

    "Automated Testing\n",
    "Even though you explored and learned how to debug applications when errors are reported, you would prefer not having to find errors in our applications. To increase the chances of having a bug-free code base, most developers rely on automated testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of their careers, most developers will just manually test their code as they develop it. By just providing a set of inputs and verifying the output of the program, you can get a basic level of confidence that our code \"works.\" But this quickly becomes tedious and does not scale as the code base grows and evolves. Automated testing allows you to record a series of steps and stimuli that you perform in our code and have a series of expected output recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is extremely efficient to reduce the number of bugs in our code base, because not only are we verifying the code, but we are also implementing it, and you keep a record of all those verifications for future modifications of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of test lines that you write for each line of code really depends on each application. There are notorious cases, such as SQLite, where orders of magnitude more lines of tests are needed than lines of code, which greatly improves confidence in the software and allows quick release of new versions as features are added without needing the extensive quality assurance (QA) that other systems might require.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated testing is similar to the QA process that we see in other engineering fields. It is a key step of all software development and should be taken into account when developing a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, having automated tests also helps you to troubleshoot, as we have a set of test scenarios that you can adapt to simulate the user's input and environment and keep what is known as a regression test (not to be confused with Regression mentioned in Machine Learning course. Regression testing is performed whenever there is a code change and it verifies whether the cases that were working earlier are still working in the same manner after the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Categorization\n",
    "One of the first things to think about when writing an automated test is \"What are we verifying?\". And that would depend on the \"level\" of testing that you are doing. There is a lot of literature about how to categorize different test scenarios in the functions that they validate and the corresponding dependencies they have. It is not the same to write a test that just validates a simple Python function in our source code, as it is to write something that validates an accounting system that connects to the internet and sends emails. To validate large systems, it is common to create different types of tests. They are usually known as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unit tests: These are tests that just alidate a small part of your code. Usually, they just validate a function with specific inputs within one of your files and only depend on code that has already been validated with other unit tests.\n",
    "System Integration tests (SIT): These are more coarse-grained tests that will either validate interactions between different components of your codebase (known as integration tests without environment) or the interactions between your code and other systems and the environment (known as integration tests with the environment).\n",
    "Functional or end-to-end tests / User Acceptance Testing (UAT): These are usually really high-level tests that depend on the environment and often on external systems that validate the solution with inputs as the user provides them.\n",
    "Say that you were to test the workings of Twitter, using the tests you are familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit test would verify one of the functions, which will check whether a tweet body is shorter than a specific length.\n",
    "An integration test would validate that, when a tweet is injected into the system, the trigger to other users is called.\n",
    "An end-to-end test is one that ensures that, when a user writes a tweet and clicks Send, they can then see it on their home page.\n",
    "Software developers tend to prefer unit tests as they don't have external dependencies and are more stable and faster to run. The further we go into more coarse-grained tests, the more we'll come across what the user will perform, but both integration and end-to-end tests usually take much longer to run, as the dependencies need to be set up and they are usually flakier because, for example, the email server might not be working on that day, meaning we would be unable to run our tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This categorization is a simplification of many experts working in the field. If you are interested in the different levels of testing and getting the right balance of tests, then a good place to start is the famous Testing Pyramid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Coverage\n",
    "Something that generates debate across the community is test coverage. When you write tests for our code, you start to exercise it and begin to hit different code paths. As you write more tests, we cover more and more of the code that you are testing. The percentage of code that you test is known as test coverage, and developers will argue that different percentages are \"the right amount.\" Getting to 100% coverage might seem an unnecessary task, but it proves to be quite useful in large codebases that need to perform tasks such as migrating from Python 2 to Python 3. However, this all depends on how much you are willing to invest in testing your application, and each developer might target a different number for each of the projects that they run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, something important to remember is that 100% coverage does not mean that your code does not have bugs. You can write tests that exercise your code but do not properly validate it, so be mindful of falling into the trap of just writing tests to hit the coverage target. Tests should be written to exercise the code with inputs that will be provided by users and try to find edge cases that can uncover issues with the assumptions that you made at the time that you wrote it, and not just to hit a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing Tests in Python with Unit Testing\n",
    "The Python standard library comes with a module, unittest, to write test scenarios and validate your code. Usually, when you are creating tests, we create a file for the test to validate the source code of another file. In that file, you can create a class that inherits from unittest.TestCase and has method names that contain the word test to be run on execution. You can record expectations through functions such as assertEquals and assertTrue, which are part of the base class, and you can, therefore, access them.\n",

    "In the next section, let's take a look at creating PIP packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a PIP Package\n",
    "When you are working with Python code, you need to differentiate between the source code tree, the source distributions (sdist), and a binary distribution (wheels for example which is explained ahead). The folder where you work on the code is known as the source code tree, which is essentially how it is presented in the folder. This also contains Git files, configuration files, and others. The source distribution is a way to package our code so that it can be executed and installed on any machine—it just contains all the source code without any development-related files. A binary distribution is similar to source distribution, but it comes with the files ready to be installed on the system—there is no execution needed in the client host. Wheels are a particular standard for binary distributions that replace the old format, Python eggs. When we consume Python wheels we just get a file that is ready to be installed without the need of any compilation or build step, just ready to be consumed. This is especially useful for Python packages with C extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to distribute our code to users, you need to create source or binary distributions and then upload them to a repository. The most common Python repository is PyPI, which allows users to install packages by using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Packaging Index (PyPI), is an official package repository maintained by the Python Software Foundation that contains Python packages. Anyone can publish packages to it, and many Python tools usually default to consume packages from it. The most common way to consume from PyPI is through pip, which is the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA). This is the recommended tool for consuming Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common tool to package our source code is setuptools. With setuptools, you can create a setup.py file that contains all the information about how to create and install the package. Setuptools comes with a method named setup, which should be called with all the metadata that we want to create a package with.\n",

    "Here's some example boilerplate code that could be copied and pasted when creating a package:\n",

    "Name: The name of the package in PyPA. It is a good practice to have it match your library or file import name.\n",
    "Version: A string that identifies the version of the package.\n",
    "Py_modules: A list of Python files to package. You can also use the package keyword to target full Python packages— you will explore how to do this in the next exercise.\n",

    "python3.7 setup.py sdist\n",
    "This will generate a file in the dist folder, which is ready to be distributed to PyPI.\n",

    "python3.7 setup.py bdist_wheel\n",

    "You can test our package by installing any of the artifacts in the dist folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, to facilitate testing, many people consider it to be good practice to place all the source code of your package within an src directory. This is done to prevent the Python interpreter from automatically finding your package, as it is part of the current working directory, as Python adds the current working directory to the Python path. If your package contains any logic about the data files that are packaged with your code, you should really use the src directory, as it will force you to work against the installed version of your package, rather than the source directory tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPA has recently created a guide on how to package projects, which contains further details than those discussed in this book.\n",

    "Creating Documentation the Easy Way\n",
    "A critical part of all software that is distributed across the world is documentation. Documentation allows the users of your code to be able to understand calling the different functions that we provide without having to read the code. There are multiple levels of documentation that you are going to explore in this topic. You will see how to write documentation that can be consumed in the console and on the web. In the purpose and size of our project, you should consider how broad our documentation should be and what kind of instructions and information it should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docstrings\n",
    "In Python, documentation is part of the language. When you declare a function, you can use docstrings to document its interface and behavior. Docstrings can be created by having a triple-quoted string block just after the function signature. This content is not only available to the reader but also to the user of the API, as it is part of a __doc__ attribute of the function, class, or module. It is the content that will be provided if we call the help function in the object passed. As an example, take a look at the contents of the __doc__ attribute of the print function:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(print.__doc__)\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 8.8: Print documentation\n",
    "It is the same content as calling help(print). You can create your own function with a __doc__ attribute, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>>def example():\n",
    "    \"\"\"Prints the example text\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Example\")\n",
    ">>>example.__doc__\n",
    "'Prints the example text' \n",
    "You can now use help in your function, by executing the \"help(example)\" which will result in the following text:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 8.9: The Help content in the example module\n",
    "Docstrings usually contain a title with a short description of the function and a body with further information about what it does in detail. Additionally, you can also document all the parameters the function takes, including its types, the return type, and whether it raises any exceptions. This is all really useful information for your users and even for ourselves when you have to use the code at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Sphinx\n",
    "Using docstrings to document APIs is useful, but quite often you need something more. You want to generate a website with guides and other information about your library. In Python, the most common way to do this is via Sphinx. Sphinx allows you to generate documentation in multiple formats, such as PDF, epub, or html, easily from RST with some markup. Sphinx also comes with multiple plugins, and some of them are useful for Python, such as generating API documentation from docstrings or allowing you to view code behind the API implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed via pip, it comes with two main CLI scripts, which the user interacts with: sphinx-build and sphinx-quickstart. The first is used to build the documentation on an existing project with Sphinx configuration, while the second can be used to quickly bootstrap a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you bootstrap a project, Sphinx will generate multiple files for you, and the most important ones are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conf.py: This contains all the user configuration for generating the documentation. This is the most common place to look for configuration parameters when you want to customize something from the Sphinx output.\n",
    "Makefile: An easy-to-use makefile that can be used to generate the documentation with a simple \"make html.\" There are other targets that can be useful, such as the one to run doctests.\n",
    "Index.rst: The main entry point for our documentation.\n",
    "Usually, most projects create a folder named docs within their source tree root to contain everything related to the documentation and Sphinx. This folder can then refer to the source code by either installing it or by adding it to the path in their configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with RST, it is best to have a quick look through sphinx-doc.org. It has a short explanation of the different special syntaxes you can find in RST that will be translated into special HTML tags such as links, anchors, tables, images, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, Sphinx is easily extendible via plugins. Some of them are part of the default distribution when you install sphinx. Plugins allow you to extend the functionality to do things such as automatically create documentation for your modules, classes, and functions by just writing a single directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are multiple themes available when you generate documentation with Sphinx—these are all configurable in conf.py. Quite often, you can find more Sphinx themes available on PyPI, which can be just installed easily via pip.\n",

    "More Complex Documentation\n",
    "In the previous exercise, you examined simple documentation for a really small module. Most libraries also include tutorials and guides along with their API documentation. Check Django, flask, or CPython as examples, as they are all generated with Sphinx.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you intend our library to be used extensively and successfully, then documentation will be a key part of it. When you want to document how an API behaves, you should use just the plain API documentation that you generated before. However, there is also room to create small guides for specific features or tutorials to walk users through the most common steps to start a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are tools such as readthedocs, which greatly simplifies the generation and hosting of documentation. You can take the project that we just generated and connect it to readthedocs through their UI to have our documentation hosted on the web and automatically regenerated every time you update the master branch of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can go to readthedocs.org to create an account and set up your repositories in GitHub to automatically generate documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source Management\n",
    "When you work with code, you need a way in which to keep a picture of how your code evolves and how changes are being applied to different files. For instance, say that, by mistake, you make changes to your code that suddenly breaks it, or you start to make changes and just want to go back to the previous version. Many people start with just copying their source code into different folders and naming them with a timestamp based on checkpoints they make on different phases of the project. This is the most rudimentary approach to version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is the system by which you keep control of code as it evolves over time. Developers have been suffering for long enough to create a piece of software that can do this job efficiently, and one of the most popular tools to do this is a Git. Git is a Distributed Version Control System that allows developers to manage their code locally as it evolves, look at the history, and easily collaborate with other developers. Git is used to manage some of the biggest projects around the world, such as the Windows kernel, CPython, Linux, or Git itself; however, at the same time, git is really useful and versatile for small projects as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repository\n",
    "A repository is an isolated workspace where you can work with your changes and have git record them and track the history of them. One repository can contain as many files and folders as you want, with all of them tracked by git.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to create a repository: you can either clone an existing repository by using git clone <url of the repository>, which will bring a local copy of a repository into your current path, or you can create a repository from an existing folder with git init, which will just mark the folder as a repository by creating the necessary files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a repository locally created, you can start to work with our version control system by issuing different commands to indicate whether you want to add changes, check previous versions, or more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commit\n",
    "A commit object is the history of our repository. Each repository has many commits: one for every time we use git commit. Each of those commits will contain the commit title, the person who added the commit to the repository, the author of the changes, the dates when the commit and the changes were made, an ID that is represented by a hash, and the hash of the parent commit. With this, you can create a tree of all the commits within the repository, which allows us to see the history of our source code. You can see the content of any commit by running git show <commit sha>.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run git commit, we create a commit from all the changes that you have in the staging area. An editor will open, which includes some meta-information such as the title and the commit body.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 8.12: Git commands showing how they interact with the repository and the Staging area\n",
    "Note: A good guide on how to write good commit messages can be found here. You suggest that you take a look after finishing this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staging Area\n",
    "When you are working locally, making changes to our files and source code, git will report that those changes happened, and they are not saved. By running git status, you can see what files were modified. If you decide that we want to save those changes in the staging area in preparation for a commit, you can add them with the git add <path> command. It can be used in files or folders to add all the files within that folder. Once they are added to the staging area, the next git commit command will save the changes in the repository through a commit object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, you don't want to add all the contents of a file to the staging area, just part of them. For this use case, both git commit and git add have an option to guide you through the different changes in the file and allow you to select which ones you want to add. This is through the -p option, which will ask you for each of the changed chunks within your code, which ones you do want to add.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undoing Local Changes\n",
    "When you are working on a file, you can run git diff to see all the changes that have been made locally but are not yet part of the staging area or a commit. Sometimes, you realize we want to undo our changes and come back to the version you have saved in the staging area or in the last commit. You can do this by checking out the file by running git checkout <path>. This applies to both files and folders. Alternatively, you can remove all local changes by git stash.\n",
    "\n",
    "If instead, you want to revert our repository back to a previous commit in history, you can do this by running git reset <commit sha>.\n",
    "\n",
    "History\n",
    "As you mentioned before, the repository has a commit history. This includes all the commits that have been performed before. You can see them by running git log, which will present you with the title, body, and some other information. The most important part of each of these entries is the sha of the commit, which uniquely represents each of the commits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring Files\n",
    "When you work with our source code, we may find that, by running our program or any other action, you have files in your repository that you don't want git to track. In that scenario, you can use a special file that has to be placed at the top of the directory and named .gitignore, which can list all the files in glob patterns that you don't want git to track. This is especially handy for adding things such as IDE-generated files, compiled Python files, and more.\n",

    "\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "In this course, you'll continue the move which started in course, Software Development, away from your individual focus on learning the syntax of the Python language toward becoming a contributing member of a Python development team. Large projects solving complex problems need expertise from multiple contributors, so it's very common to work on code with one or more colleagues as a developer community. Having already seen how to use git version control in course, Software Development, you'll apply that knowledge in this course to working with teams. You'll be using GitHub, branches, and pull requests in order to keep your project in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving on, in the IT world, when you deliver a certain project, at some point, you'll want to deliver your code to your customers or stakeholders. An important part of the deployment process is making sure that the customer's system has the libraries and modules that your software needs, and also the same versions that you were developing against. For this, you'll learn how to use conda to create baseline Python environments with particular libraries present, and how to replicate those environments on another system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will look at Docker, which is a popular way to deploy software to internet servers and cloud infrastructure. You'll learn how to create a container that includes your conda environment and your Python software, and how to run the containerized software within Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you'll learn some useful techniques for developing real-world Python software. These include learning how to take advantage of parallel programming, how to parse command-line arguments, and how to profile your Python to discover and fix performance problems.\n",

    "Developing Collaboratively\n",
    "In course, Software Development, you used git to keep track of the changes you made to your Python project. At its heart, membership of a programming team involves multiple people sharing their changes through git and ensuring that you are incorporating everybody else's changes when doing your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways for people to work together using git. The developers of the Linux kernel each maintain their own repository and share potential changes over email, which they each choose whether to incorporate or not. Large companies, including Facebook and Google, use trunk-based development, in which all changes must be made on the main branch, usually called the \"master.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "A common workflow popularized by support in the GitHub user interface is the pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the pull request workflow, you maintain your repository as a fork in GitHub of the canonical version from which software releases are made, often referred to as upstream or origin. You make a small collection of related changes, each representing progress toward a single bug fix or new feature, in a named branch on your own repository, which you push to your hosted repository with git push. When you are ready, you submit a pull request to the upstream repository. The team reviews these changes together in the pull request, and you add any further work needed to the branch. When the team is happy with the pull request, a supervisor or another developer merges it upstream, and the changes are \"pulled\" into the canonical version of the software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the pull request workflow is that it's made easy by the user interface in applications such as Bitbucket, GitHub, and GitLab. The disadvantage comes from keeping those branches around while the pull request is being created and is under review. It's easy to fall behind as other work goes into the upstream repository, leaving your branch out of date and introducing the possibility that your change will conflict with some other changes, and those conflicts will need a resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with fresh changes and conflicts as they arise, rather than as a huge headache when it comes time to merge the pull request, you use git to fetch changes from the upstream repository, and either merge them into your branch or rebase your branch on the up-to-date upstream revision. Merging combines the history of commits on two branches and rebasing reapplies commits such that they start at the tip of the branch you are rebasing against. Your team should decide which of these approaches they prefer.\n",

There's no recipe to follow to write fast code: if there were, you could have taught you that in courses and there wouldn't need to be a section on performance now. And, of course, speed isn't the only performance goal: you might want to reduce memory use or increase the number of simultaneous operations that can be in-flight.

As you'll see in the next exercise, not all \"optimizations\" actually make your code faster, and careful measurement and thought are needed to decide whether the optimization is worth pursuing and retaining. In practice, cProfile is often used when trying to understand why code is taking longer than expected to execute. For example, you might write an iterative calculation that suddenly takes 10 minutes to compute after scaling to 1,000 iterations. With cProfile, you might discover that this is due to some inefficient function in the pandas library, which you could potentially avoid to speed up your code.\n",
